## About

This is a client-side Movie Database application that uses a movie API (The Movie Database â€” TMDb) to show lists of movies, details, and search results. The UI aims to resemble common streaming platforms (catalog, hero banners, watch/list features). The repository is built with Vite and React. This was my beginner project using React.js which taught me how API's, Routing work in React.js.
